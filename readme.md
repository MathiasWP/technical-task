# Kvist technical task

**Mission:** Create a currency converter application with Svelte based on the design provided.

### User stories

- As a user i want to click the name of the currency to change it .
    - Clicking on the currency should open a native option-list with the following currencies: Euro, United States Dollar, NOK and IRR.

- As a user i want to type in the amount i want to convert and automatically see the result.
    - The user should only use the top input
    - The convertion should happen automatically, no need for clicking any buttons.


### Extra user story

- As a user i want to click the button in the middle to change the direction of the convertion.
    - By default the top input is the only input, but adding this feature requires also the bottom to behave as an input.  
    - Clicking the button should make the arrow turn 180 deg to clearly indicate the direction
